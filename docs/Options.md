# CMake Options

To change these options, add `-DOPTION_NAME=NEWVALUE` to the command line.

- On Qt Creator, go to Project -> Current Configuration

Notes:
- Defaults are marked per-platform.
- "Non-UNIX" just means Windows/MSVC and Android (yes, macOS is UNIX
- Android generally doesn't need to change anything; if you do, go to `src/android/app/build.gradle.kts`
- To set a boolean variable to on, use `ON` for the value; to turn it off, use `OFF`
- If a variable is mentioned as being e.g. "ON" for a specific platform(s), that means it is defaulted to OFF on others
- TYPE is always boolean unless otherwise specified
- Format:
  * `OPTION_NAME` (TYPE DEFAULT) DESCRIPTION
