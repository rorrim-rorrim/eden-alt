## Steps

1. Right-Click the game you want to apply the mod to and select **Open Mod Data Location.**
2. Create new folder inside the mod directory with the name of the mod.
3. Extract the downloaded mod (if applicable) to a temporary directory.
4. Locate the ***exefs*** and ***romfs*** folders inside the extracted mod - usually *atmosphere/contents/<TITLE_ID>*.
5. Copy the ***exefs*** and ***romfs*** folders into the mod folder you created earlier.
6. Restart Eden.
7. Right-Click the game you installed the mod to and hit *Configure Game*.
8. Look in the **Add-Ons** tab and observe that the Mod Name (or whatever you named the folder to earlier) now appears on the list and is selected.
9. Hit **OK** and launch the game.  Your mod should now be active.

    ***NOTE:*** Your mod may not show up on the home screen initially, if it does not.  Hit the refresh button in the bottom-left of the window or go back into *Configure Game* and disable the mod by unchecking it, and clicking **OK**.  It should now appear on the home screen in the Add-Ons column correctly.  Just go back into the *Configure Game* and enable it again if you use this method.
