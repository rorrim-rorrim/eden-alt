## Disabling Updates/DLC

Upon occasion you may find that you want to disable a certain DLC or Update (incompatibility with a mod, causes significant regression, etc.). Luckily the process if very easy to do so.

1. *Right-Click* the game for which you want to disable the additional content.
2. Select *Configure Game.*
3. Uncheck the box next to the DLC or Update you want to disable and hit **OK**.
4. The listing should now reflect that it has been disabled with a **[D]** before the entry.  If you load the game, you will observe that the reported version is not updated (assuming the game reports this information).
