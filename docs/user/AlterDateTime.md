Use this guide whenever you want to modify the Date or Time that Eden reports to games.  This can be useful for modifying RNG elements, skipping wait times in games, etc.

## Steps

1. Navigate to *Emulation → Configure*.    
2. Click on the **System** item on the left-hand side navigation, then check the *Custom RTC Date* box.
3. The Date/Time option now becomes editable.  Set it to the value you want and hit **OK**.
4. GREAT SCOTT! We have time traveled!  You can of course go forward or backward in time (as long as it is not before the year 1970) and your game should update accordingly (e.g. certain *Super Mario Odyssey* moons that take time for flowers to grow will now be fully grown.).
