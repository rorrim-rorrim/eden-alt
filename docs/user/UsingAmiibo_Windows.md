## Steps

---

1. Launch Eden and launch the game you want to load Amiibo for.

    ***TIP***: You must be in-game before you can emulate scanning an Amiibo

    </aside>

1. Navigate to the Amiibo section of the game.  The method for initiating the scanning varies from game to game, for *Captain Toad’s Treasure Tracker*, you need to go to the press the **+** button when on the level select.  You will need to look up how to do so with your specific game.
2. Upon activating the Amiibo scan functionality, you should get a Scan page.  Eden is now looking for an Amiibo file to be loaded, which emulates scanning an Amiibo on actual hardware.
3. Navigate to **File > Load/Remove Amiibo…**, or press the hotkey to do the same (**F2** on keyboard by default).
4. In the file explorer that opens, navigate to the amiibo file you want to use.

    <aside>

    ***NOTE***: It seems the scanning functionality is spotty and will sometimes throw a "*The current game is not looking for amiibos*” message, even though it is.  Usually you just need to try loading it again or restarting the scanning from the game.  In some situations it was only resolved by restarting the game.

5. Upon loading a valid file, you will get a confirmation screen and your bonus content will be unlocked/functionality activated.
6. Repeat with any other Amiibo you want to use.
