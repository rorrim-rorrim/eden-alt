# User Handbook - Third party tools and extras

The Eden emulator by itself lacks some functionality - or otherwise requires external files (such as packaging) to operate correctly in a given OS. Addendum to that some repositories provide nightly or specialised builds of the emulator.

While most of the links mentioned in this guide are relatively "safe"; we urge users to use their due diligence and appropriatedly verify the integrity of all files downloaded and ensure they're not compromised.
