## Why am I Seeing This?

Recent versions of MacOS (Catalina & newer) introduced the **Gatekeeper** security functionality, requiring software to be signed by Apple or a trusted (aka - paying) developer.  If the signature isn’t on the list of trusted ones, it will stop the program from executing and display the message above.

## Steps

1. Open the *System Settings* panel.
2. Navigate to *Privacy & Security*.
3. Scroll down and observe the following message under the **Security** settings.
4. Select **Open Anyway** to tell your Mac that you trust the application.
5. You will now get another window appearing to verify you want to open Eden.  Select **Open Anyway**.
6. You will be prompted for your password to authorize the request.  Enter the credentials of an account that has permission to modify settings and press **OK**.
7. Eden will now open and any subsequent launches of the program will not prompt this.
