## Other Information

Requests that appear suspicious, automated, OR blank will generally be automatically filtered. In cases of suspicion, or any of the invalid reasons listed above, you may receive an email back asking for clarification.

You MUST use the following format:

```
Subject: [Eden Git] Registration Request
Username: <Your Desired Username>
Email: <Your Desired Email>

```

Email notifications are disabled for the time being, so you don't have to use a real email. If you wish to remain anonymous, either send a separate email asking for access to a shared anonymous account, *or* create a fake username and email.
