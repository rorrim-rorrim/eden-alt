# CPMUtil Tooling

CPMUtil's tooling entirely revolves around the `cpmutil.sh` script. It contains various functions to aid with package maintenance, such as sanity checks, updates, formatting, prefetching, adding/removing packages, and much more. These are now self-documenting, so view the scripts yourself or run the cpmutil script for help.
