# Icon variations

These icons are licensed under GPLv3. Please see the [script for generating icons](../../tools/README.md) and appropriatedly redirect for seasonal icons.

- `base_named.svg` - Named variant.
- `base_small.svg`: Variant used for tiny icons (16x16, 64x64, etc).
- `base.svg`: Variant without branding/naming.

Try to keep the icons simple. And preferably automatically be able to be generated (to reduce maintanaince burden). Additionally keep the files small (use `svgo` and `optipng`) to not clutter the git.
