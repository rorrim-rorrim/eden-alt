This directory stores translation patches (TS files) for yuzu Qt frontend. This directory is linked with the [Eden project on transifex](https://app.transifex.com/edenemu/eden-emulator), so you can update the translation by executing `tx pull -t -a`. If you want to contribute to the translation, please go the transifex link and submit your translation there. This directory on the main repo will be synchronized with transifex periodically. Do not directly open PRs on github to modify the translation.

When creating/improving translations, please keep in mind:

- You are responsible for providing accurate translations that do NOT contain illicit content or messages,
- Many of our developers do not speak the languages you may be translating, so will only be able to help with confusions about the source language,
- And bad-faith translations or attempts to insert illicit content may result in an immediate removal of access.
